# Update-WSUSComputerOperatingSystems
Update OS Description field in Windows Server Update Services with additional edition and release information

Do you still need to use WSUS in a location with low bandwidth / unreliable Internet connections, or in an airgapped environment, even once it is [deprecated](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/windows-server-update-services-wsus-deprecation/ba-p/4250436)?

Do you think that preventing someone from [exercising rights you previously granted them](https://community.spiceworks.com/t/maybe-wam-wsus-is-not-longer-free/655421/37) is not behaviour that should be financially rewarded?

This script can be run against a WSUS server to add additional edition and release information to the OS Description field, e.g. 'Windows 11 Enterprise 23H2' and 'Windows Server 2022 Enterprise'.
